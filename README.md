This component creates an integration that provides the following entities to control [Hella's ONYX.CENTER](https://www.hella.info/) via Home Assistant:

- **raffstore/shutter** entities
- **(dimmable) light** entities
- **weather station** sensor entities

---

## Limitations

This integration is under development and based on personal needs and Hella's API design and Home Assistant's
interpretation of values diverges in a few aspects.

Therefore, a few limitations are imposed on/by this integration:

| Limitation | Description| Bound By |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Shutter Position | Home Assistant takes the position 0 as closed and 100 as open, Hella the opposite. | Home Assistant |
| Tilt Position | Home Assistant takes the position 0 as closed and 100 as open, Hella's values range between 0-90 and 0-180. | Home Assistant / Hella |
| Light Brightness | Home Assistant takes the dim value 0 as off and 100 as on, Hella's values range between 0-65535. | Home Assistant / Hella |

### Realtime Updates / Streaming API

Since `v2` of the ONYX API, a dedicated event streaming endpoint is available which pushed occurring events from the
ONYX.CENTER to all clients; however, pushes only include partial updates.

The integration makes use of this and keeps a connection open to the ONYX API server to update the devices in
near-realtime. Since exceptions can occur, and the endpoint only pushes partial updates, all device states are updated
periodically as well to ensure current states are available and correct. Please ensure a proper update interval,
suggested is anywhere between 30-180 minutes.

This integration uses API `v3`.

> [!WARNING]
> The streaming API uses a HTTP GET request which, unfortunately, is timing out and ending the connection every ~10 minutes.
> Currently, the client is reconnecting after a short backoff time.
>
> Hence, errors in your Home Assistant log like `[onyx_client.client] Unexpected exception: ClientPayloadError('Response payload is not completed'). Retrying with backoff Xs.` are to be expected.
>
> The issue is tracked here: <https://github.com/muhlba91/onyx-homeassistant-integration/issues/30>.

## Installation

I recommend installation through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/):

- Ensure HACS is installed.
- Search for and install the `Hella ONYX.CENTER` integration.

### Releases / Versions

The integration offers the following possibilities:

- `main`: the latest stable release
- `v*`: releases following semantic versioning - if you need to pin the version, choose one of those

## Configuration

Add it from the **Integrations menu**, set the configuration, and you're good to go.

| Configuration Key | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| API Code | The code retrieved by the ONYX app when allowing a new client to connect. |
| Fingerprint | Your ONYX.CENTER fingerprint. |
| Access Token | The access token. |
| Scan Interval | Interval for polling for updates. This is used as a fallback if near realtime updates are failing and can be set to a higher value. |
| \[Lights] Minimum Dim Duration | The minimum dim duration to use when dimming a light. (Default: 200) |
| Disable partial updates? | The integration relies on the streaming API. Hence, only partial device data will be retrieved. Enable this option to always retrieve the full device data. *Attention*: this may lead to more API requests and is discouraged. |

To configure the integration you can either directly specify a **fingerprint** and an **access token** or use the issued **API code** from the ONYX app directly.
The integration will then exchange this code through the API to retrieve the fingerprint and access token for your ONYX.CENTER.

## Entities

Once configured, the integration creates entities for:

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Cover | Manage the shutter. ([API Reference](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/cover/)) |
| Light | Manage the (dimmable) light. ([API Reference](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/light/)) |
| Sensor (Device Type) | The device type of the ONYX device. ([API Reference](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/)) |
| Sensor (Weather Humidity) | The humidity of the weather sensor. ([API Reference](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/)) |
| Sensor (Weather Temperature) | The temperature of the weather sensor. ([API Reference](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/)) |
| Sensor (Weather Air Pressure) | The air pressure of the weather sensor. ([API Reference](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/)) |
| Sensor (Weather Wind Peak) | The wind peak of the weather sensor. ([API Reference](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/)) |
| Sensor (Weather Sun Brightness Peak) | The sun brightness peak of the weather sensor. ([API Reference](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/)) |
| Sensor (Weather Sun Brightness Sink) | The sun brightness sink of the weather sensor. ([API Reference](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/sensor/)) |

The **following ONYX devices** are **only community tested** due to the lack of a testing device:

- Light (thank you [@clostermannshof](https://github.com/clostermannshof))
- Weather Station (thank you [@mrogin-technic](https://github.com/mrogin-technic))
